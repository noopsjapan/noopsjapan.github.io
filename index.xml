NoOps stands for &amp;ldquo;No Uncomfortable Ops&amp;rdquo;.It is the combination of technology, architecture, and activities that enable the elimination of uncomfortable system operations. Designing container-based highly resilient systems, utilizing DevOps, automated monitoring/configuration and eliminating SRE Toil exemplify this approach.
Core capabilities, which are necessary to achieve NoOps, are high resiliency, observability, configurability, and security gurantees. Leveraging these capabilities allow us to realize the experience of self-healing, zero-downtime maintenance, adaptive scale, and safety everywhere.</description></item></channel></rss>
